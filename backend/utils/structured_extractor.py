def extract_structured_resume(text):

You are an intelligent resume parser.

Your job is to analyze the following resume content and return a structured JSON of its contents.

Instructions:
- Detect all section headings dynamically (e.g., SUMMARY, EDUCATION, SKILLS, AREA OF INTEREST, etc.).
- If a section has subheadings (like project titles, institutions), group bullets under them.
- If no subheadings exist, use "" as the subheading.
- Each section must include bullet points that end in full stops.
- STRICTLY PRESERVE the order of sections exactly as they appear in the resume. Do not rearrange them.
- Output the JSON sections in the same sequence as their original order in the resume text.


Return ONLY the JSON object â€” no explanation, no code blocks.

Resume:
\"\"\"{text}\"\"\"
